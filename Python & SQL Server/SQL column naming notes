SQL column name rules:

1. 
if column names with mixed upper and lower case:
want to retrieve Id column -> select id from xxtable (will get error) cause, SQL will read it as ID
so use select "Id" from xxtable

2.
SQL will map " " (space) to underscore, and also "()" will also be mapped as underscores
Ex: city name = city_name 
ex: city(LA) = city__LA_
